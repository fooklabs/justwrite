Jason Segel Reveals His David Foster Wallace Syllabus at BookCon
<p>When Jason Segel found himself in front of an audience of book-lovers at New York’s BookCon on Sunday, he took the opportunity to discuss his two most bookish projects, which are aimed at very different groups of readers: his YA series Nightmares!, the second book of which will be published in September, and his role as David Foster Wallace in the upcoming biopic The End of the Tour, out in July.</p>

<p>Author Lev Grossman interviewed Segel onstage and asked him how he prepared to play Wallace. Segel said he watched a few Charlie Rose interviews, “but I really feel like the soul of David Foster Wallace is in his writing,” he said. "The short-form shows you just how funny he is. There is a book called Consider the Lobster that if you haven’t read, you should, and A Supposedly Fun Thing I’ll Never Do Again, which are both brilliant. But Infinite Jest really is what did it for me ... I felt like I was reading a man who was sending out sort of a distress beacon saying, ‘Does anyone else feel dissatisfied?’ like, ‘Does anyone else feel alone?’” He added: "Reading Infinite Jest really changed how I view books." While reading a fight scene in the novel, “I was panting," said Segel. "I didn’t know a book could do that. Truly, I didn’t know a book could have that effect on me viscerally."</p>

<p>Segel was further inspired by Wallace's famous 2005 Kenyon College commencement address. “You hear somebody reminding himself and saying, ‘These are the things. These are the things to stay focused on. This is what’s important,’” Segel said. “And it’s not easy, because, as he talks about in that speech, our default setting is not to feel that way. There’s a reason that we call people who are doing well ‘well-adjusted.’ It’s because it’s an adjustment to feel union with your fellow man and patient with the guy in front of you in line when you feel like everything is happening at you. Like, ‘These people don’t realize I’m trying to get somewhere.’ Everyone’s trying to get somewhere, everyone’s got some place to be and you’re a part of that, and that’s beautiful. There’s joy in that.”</p>

<p>Segel also had access to tapes of journalist David Lipsky's interview with Wallace, which served as the basis for a 1996 Rolling Stone profile and Lipsky's 2010 book Although Of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself: A Road Trip with David Foster Wallace, on which The End of the Tour is based. "I have the recordings. David Lipsky recorded these four days on audio. It's two guys talking. They are having the most interesting discussion you’ve ever heard in your life. It’s fun and hearing the smartest guys in the room talk about pop culture is a really interesting thing. You get tired after four days, and to have that devolve into the real stuff is where I think it gets really, really interesting.”</p>

<p>“What separates an author and mind like David Foster Wallace," said Segel, "is he has the ability to articulate. A lot of people are sitting there feeling it, feeling confused about why they don’t feel satisfied. And David Foster Wallace said, ‘Maybe it’s this. Maybe that’s why.’”</p>


Are Parents of YouTube Stars Exploiting Their Kids?
<p>Today I read a pair of editorials that got me thinking about children being used in viral videos.  Are we going too far?  Are some parents going to live with regret for years for making their kid a star on YouTube?</p>

<p>The first article that got me pondering this question was this negative review Roger Ebert gave the new movie Kick-Ass—short version: he thinks it's morally reprehensible.  One of his biggest complaints is the use of an 11-year-old character (the actress playing her is 14) in multiple scenes of graphic violence involving guns and knives and more.</p>

<p>The second article was a CNN.com piece called Kids On YouTube: How Much Is Too Much? It's a very interesting read and an even more fascinating debate.</p>

<p>Should kids be used in viral videos?  Are they being exploited?  Is it a bad influence on child viewers of the video?  The list of questions goes on and on.</p>

<p>The CNN piece highlights a show called "The Yippity Yo Cooking Show” [Tubular Creator ProfilesView Creator Profile], which features a hilarious 3-year-old in the kitchen doing what 3-year-olds are prone to do:  scream, smear food products on her face, and giggle frequently.  I'll go ahead and insert my own observation here on the irony of CNN wondering if the videos exploit the child while simultaneously plastering her face and name on one of the most-read news sites online—if the videos are exploitative, then so is the article, CNN… which kind of tells me which side of the debate you're on.</p>

<p>Anyway, the girl's father intentionally avoids mentioning the family's last name, betraying his own internal misgivings about making his toddler a star, and even goes so far as to suggest that they can always pull the video down when the girl is older and more likely to be embarrassed by the thing.</p>

<p>And this kind of illustrates the problem.  Parents are aware enough of the dangers of the Internet to keep their last name a secret, but naïve enough about how the Internet works to think that pulling a video off YouTube in a few years will mean that it's actually gone.</p>

<p>This "kids on YouTube" issue has been debated almost since online video arrived on the scene.  Will Ferrell and Adam McKay took heat three years ago when McKay's daughter (2-years-old at the time) was the star of a video where she played a foul-mouthed landlord to Ferrell's rent-deficient tenant.  David After Dentist creator, David DeVore, has been accused of exploiting his son in a vulnerable situation (drugged up after dental surgery) and some have gone so far as to suggest it borders on abuse.  It's worth noting that DeVore now sells T-shirts, makes media appearances, and has earned thousands of dollars (many of which have gone to charity), and that his son seems totally fine with it all.</p>

<p>Just a couple weeks ago we wrote about the Scarface school play video where elementary school children performed a slightly-tamer stage version of the violent film.</p>

<p>My stance all along has generally been that the issue of whether this is right or wrong (using your kids in YouTube videos) is really more of a personal decision for the parents.  It's hard for me to feel like I have a right to tell another parent they can't put their cute kid on the Internet if they're fine with it.  Heck, in the weekly Viral Round Up I've gone so far as to playfully encourage you to use your cute or talented kids in your viral attempts.</p>

<p>And yet, there has to be a line drawn somewhere, right ? We don't let kids stay in homes where they are physically abused or neglected, so on some level this society of ours believes that some parents are so bad that they need to be corrected by the cops, the government, or their fellow citizens.  If, for example, a video hit the web featuring a parent hitting their child, then that would probably lead pretty quickly to an arrest of some kind.</p>

<p>But entertainment videos?  Scripted videos made for fun?  Harmless conversations between children and parents?  Those are not abusive, nor is it exploitation.  Listen, I refuse to buy the notion that David DeVore or Adam McKay are exploiting their kids in a way that is illegal or immoral while the entire country continues to celebrate reality TV moms who have somewhere between 8 and 19 kids they shove in front of a camera.  Those people are getting rich off their kids.  Why should wannabe Internet filmmakers be denied the same opportunity?</p>

<p>Parents have been putting their child-actor offspring on television shows and in R-rated movies for decades.  One of the earliest film stars ever was Shirley Temple, who was three years of age when she began her acting career in 1932.  This is not a new debate, it's just a new incarnation of an ancient debate.  The Internet changes the landscape because of its permanence and its accessibility.</p>

<p>Ten years ago, a funny video of your daughter playing Julia Child would be shown in your living room on your VCR to friends and family.  In 2010, it's far easier to share with all your friends by uploading to YouTube—but that step also makes it public and lasting.  Don't forget that most of these parents have no idea their child's video is going to go viral and be seen 56 million times—David DeVore and the Yippity Yo father both claim they simply hadn't conceived of their videos going viral, but merely started with something they wanted to share with friends.  Maybe the real problem is the Internet—and a lack of understanding as to how it works—and not parents putting their kids in funny videos?</p>

<p>I'm not a parent, so it's hard for me to put myself into the mind of one.  But for me, the issue would be about protecting them from celebrity and attention they aren't old enough to even decide they want.  Which means it's a subjective issue.  Some people have a problem with it, while others don't.  It's as divisive an issue as violent video games, children playing violent sports, or what age a child should get their first job (I was 9 when I got a paper route, for what it's worth).  Newsflash:  some folks have different ideas on parenting than you do, and that doesn't make them wrong.  While people who put their child in a viral video may be bad parents according to some, they aren't doing anything illegal or immoral… making this much ado about nothing, as most similar "controversies" are.</p>

<p>Any parents out there that have uploaded videos of their children to YouTube want to weigh?  Or the opposite... someone who decided against using their child in a video?  I would love to hear from someone directly involved in this kind of thing.</p>

Reading Literary Fiction Improves “Mind-Reading” Skills finds a study from the New School for social research
<p>Heated debates about the quantifiable value of arts and literature are a common feature of American social discourse. Now, two researchers from The New School for Social Research have published a paper in Science demonstrating that reading literary fiction enhances a set of skills and thought processes fundamental to complex social relationships—and functional societies.</p>

<p>Ph.D. candidate David Comer Kidd and his advisor, professor of psychology Emanuele Castano performed five experiments to measure the effect of reading literary fiction on participants’ Theory of Mind (ToM), the complex social skill of “mind-reading” to understand others’ mental states. Their paper, which appears in the Oct. 3 issue of Science is entitled “Reading Literary Fiction Improves Theory of Mind.”

<p>To choose texts for their study, Kidd and Castano relied on expert evaluations to define three types of writing: literary fiction, popular fiction, and nonfiction. Literary fiction works were represented by excerpts from recent National Book Award finalists or winners of the 2012 PEN/O. Henry Prize for short fiction; popular fiction works were drawn from Amazon.com bestsellers or an anthology of recent popular fiction; and non-fiction works were selected from Smithsonian Magazine.</p>

<p>After participants read texts from one of the three genres, Kidd and Castano tested their ToM capabilities using several well-established measures. One of these measures is the “Reading the Mind in the Eyes” test, which asks participants to look at black-and-white photographs of actors’ eyes and indicate the emotion expressed by that actor (see Figure 1 below). Another one is the Yoni test, which includes both affective trials and cognitive ones (see Figure 2 below). “We used several measures of ToM to make sure the effects were not specific to one type of measure, thus accumulating converging evidence for our hypothesis, ” the researchers said.</p>

<p>Across the five experiments, Kidd and Castano found that participants who were assigned to read literary fiction performed significantly better on the ToM tests than did participants assigned to the other experimental groups, who did not differ from one another.</p>

<p>The study shows that not just any fiction is effective in fostering ToM, rather the literary quality of the fiction is the determining factor. The literary texts used in the experiments had vastly different content and subject matter, but all produced similarly high ToM results.</p>

<p>“Experiment One showed that reading literary fiction, relative to nonfiction improves performance on an affective ToM task. Experiments Two through Five showed that this effect is specific to literary fiction,” the paper reports.</p>

<p>Kidd and Castano suggest that the reason for literary fiction’s impact on ToM is a direct result of the ways in which it involves the reader. Unlike popular fiction, literary fiction requires intellectual engagement and creative thought from its readers. “Features of the modern literary novel set it apart from most bestselling thrillers or romances. Through the use of […] stylistic devices, literary fiction defamiliarizes its readers,” Kidd and Castano write. “Just as in real life, the worlds of literary fiction are replete with complicated individuals whose inner lives are rarely easily discerned but warrant exploration.”</p>

<p>“We see this research as a step towards better understanding the interplay between a specific cultural artifact, literary fiction, and affective and cognitive processes,” Kidd and Castano say.</p>

God damn: Of Mice and Men & The Kite Runner face bans in Idaho and North
<p>Parents can be so embarrassing! According to the Los Angeles Times, concerned moms and dads in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, and Asheville, North Carolina, are lobbying to have John Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men and Khaled Hosseini’s The Kite Runner banned from their respective high schools’ curricula.</p>

<p>Mary Jo Finney, a Coeur d’Alene parent, told the Spokesman Review that Steinbeck’s classic novel “is neither a quality story nor a page turner.” Ms. Finney further objects to the book’s liberal use of profanities like “God damn” and “bastard,” which, by her count, come in at 102 instances in the space of 110 pages. “There was just too darn much cussing,” School Board Trustee Dave Eubanks agreed. “We have a lot of families in our community, moms and dads, who are trying to raise their children with traditional family values and traditional religious values . . . I don’t think we should be undermining them,” he went on.</p>

<p>The use of “profanity” has also become a problem in Asheville, where The Kite Runner has been pulled from a high school curriculum. Parent Lisa Baldwin, who filed the complaint, told the Citizen-Times that she objected to the book’s language and its “adult themes.” “The description of the book the teacher included mentioned that there was a rape, but not that it was the rape of a child and it was the homosexual rape of a child, which I felt was something parents needed to know,” she said.</p>

<p>Both schools plan to come to a decision about the books within the next few weeks.</p>

<p>According to the American Library Association, there were 311 formal challenges reported to the Office for Intellectual Freedom last year, and 5,099 reported between 2000 and 2009:</p>

<p>Well. God damn.</p>
